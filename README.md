# Portfoilo

Welcome to my portfolio for PRORG2006 Advanced Programming 2024. This portfolio contains all the work I have done in this course. That includes every lab and one open ended lab.

Lab 01-06 are in Haskell and Lab 06-15 are in Rust. The open ended lab is Lab 15.

NOTE: For lab 15 specifically, to view the client-server implementation, you can find it [here](https://git.gvk.idi.ntnu.no/course/prog2006/prog2006-2024-workspace/mosazghi/rust/-/tree/lab-15-socket-mode?ref_type=heads).
